## 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using a **Linear Regression** model based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, location, and more. The goal is to build an interpretable and efficient machine learning model that can help users estimate property prices.

## 💡 Problem Statement
Real estate valuation is one of the most essential tools for investors, agents, and buyers. This project tackles the problem of price estimation using historical housing data and regression analysis.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from **Kaggle**:
- [🏡 House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prokshitha/home-value-insights)

**Features include:**
-`Square_Footage: The size of the house in square feet. Larger homes typically have higher prices.`
-`Num_Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the house. More bedrooms generally increase the value of a home.`
-`Num_Bathrooms: The number of bathrooms in the house. Houses with more bathrooms are typically priced higher.`
-`Year_Built: The year the house was built. Older houses may be priced lower due to wear and tear.`
-`Lot_Size: The size of the lot the house is built on, measured in acres. Larger lots tend to add value to a property.`
-`Garage_Size: The number of cars that can fit in the garage. Houses with larger garages are usually more expensive.`
-`Neighborhood_Quality: A rating of the neighborhood’s quality on a scale of 1-10, where 10 indicates a high-quality neighborhood. Better neighborhoods usually command higher prices.`
-`House_Price (Target Variable): The price of the house, which is the dependent variable you aim to predict.`

**Target variable:**
- `House_Price` (the price of the house)
